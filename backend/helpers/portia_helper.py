    START_COLAB_PROCESS = ("""
        Trigger: user has clicked the UI action/button (label examples: "Start Colab Process", "Activate AI")
        for one selected collaboration/brand email displayed in the grid/list. Once triggered,
        run this workflow one instruction at a time and return a single coherent JSON summary
        for the UI to present and for subsequent autonomous actions.

        Step 1) CONTEXT & PARSING
            - Accept the selected email (raw text, thread link, metadata) and optional
                user preference context appended by caller.
            - Parse and return `email_parsed` with: { sender, sender_email, brand, subject,
                offer_summary, proposed_deliverables, compensation_terms, exclusivity, deadlines,
                attachments, thread_link, received_at }.

        Step 2) PREFERENCE MATCHING
            - Compare parsed fields with the creator's stored preferences (tone, min_comp,
                allowed_exclusivity, timeline_limits, deliverable_format). Return `analysis`:
                { fit: high|medium|low, relevance_notes, missing_info: [...], risk_flags: [...] }.

        Step 3) DECIDE & ROUTE
            - Based on `analysis`, choose a single `next_action` with `confidence_score`:
                * ready_to_proceed  -> TIMELINE 1 (prepare/send contract)
                * need_clarification -> TIMELINE 2 (ask questions / iterate)
                * reject            -> Draft polite decline
            - Provide rationale for decision and an ordered `next_steps` array.

        Step 4) TIMELINE 1 (ready_to_proceed)
            - Draft `temporary_contract` including: summary_terms, payment_terms,
                deliverables, milestones, timeline, acceptance_criteria, basic clauses (IP,
                termination, exclusivity). Keep it creator-friendly and editable.
            - Draft `suggested_reply` (subject, body) that attaches or embeds the contract,
                clearly lists next steps, and offers points for negotiation.
            - Provide a UI action set for the creator: ["preview_contract", "send_contract_and_email",
                "save_draft", "schedule_meeting", "edit_terms"].

        Step 5) TIMELINE 2 (need_clarification)
            - Generate `clarifying_questions` targeting missing/ambiguous fields.
            - Draft `suggested_reply` to request clarifications and optionally propose
                provisional terms. Produce `temporary_contract_draft` skeleton for iteration.
            - Provide UI action set: ["send_questions", "save_draft", "escalate_to_human"].

        Step 6) REJECT
            - Draft a concise, polite `suggested_reply` explaining reasons and optionally
                offer alternatives. Provide UI action: ["send_decline", "save_note"].

        Step 7) AUTONOMOUS TOOL USE
            - The agent may autonomously choose to perform allowed side-tasks (if permitted
                by user settings): e.g., schedule a meeting, create a calendar event, save
                contract to docs, or open a negotiation thread. Enumerate chosen `autonomous_actions`.

        Step 8) ITERATION & LOOP
            - When partner replies, re-run Steps 1-7. Always include `assumptions`, `sources`,
                and a short `rationale` for changes between iterations. Stop iterating when
                `next_action` == ready_to_proceed and creator confirms, or when `reject` is final.

        OUTPUT schema (single JSON):
            {
                "email_parsed": {...},
                "analysis": {...},
                "next_action": "ready_to_proceed|need_clarification|reject",
                "confidence_score": 0-1,
                "suggested_reply": {"subject":"...","body":"..."},
                "temporary_contract_draft": {...},
                "clarifying_questions": [...],
                "autonomous_actions": [...],
                "assumptions": [...],
                "next_steps": [...]
            }

        UI notes for caller: present the email list/grid; on selection show this JSON with
        quick-action buttons (preview contract, send email, ask questions, schedule meeting,
        save to docs). Agent must always include clear `assumptions` and not auto-send
        anything requiring funds/signature without explicit creator confirmation.

        Keep instructions explicit and stepwise to make outputs deterministic and easily
        mapped to UI actions. If caller provides the raw email and/or full user preference
        profile after this prompt, incorporate them into all steps.
